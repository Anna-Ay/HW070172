*From*: "Modeling: A Study in Words and Meanings" by Willard McCarty
>> Out on site, you were never parted from your plans.
They were your Bible. They got dog-eared, yellowed,
smeared with mud, peppered with little holes from
where you had unrolled them on the ground. But
although so sacred, the plans were only the start.
Once you got out there on the site everything was
different. No matter how carefully done, the plans
could not foresee the *variables*. It was always
interesting, this moment when you saw for the first
time the actual site rather than the idealised
drawings of it.
